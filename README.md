A simplistic modeling system for superconductors
This is only a very simplistic model or super conductors which can calculate a metals critical temperature
(ie the temperature which if the metal is cooled below the metal will enter its superconducting phase)
so long as the energy gap at the fermi level is know (this can be found with experimental data,
There is also a feature for the reverse calculation where the energy gap at the Fermi level can be found if the Critical Temperature is known
There is then an option for the display of this relationship through the use of a graph
Finally there is a visual demonstration of what happens when a metal is in its super conducting state
